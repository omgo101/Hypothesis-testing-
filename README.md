### degrees of freedom
the maximum number of logically independent values, which are values that have the freedom to vary, in the data sample.
the number of independent values that can vary in an analysis without breaking any constraints. It is an essential idea that appears in many contexts throughout statistics including hypothesis tests, probability distributions, and linear regression. Learn how this fundamental concept affects the power and precision of your analysis  <br />
it is used to learning model more

One-tailed tests allow for the possibility of an effect in one direction. Two-tailed tests test for the possibility of an effect in two directions—positive and negative.<br />
#### what is p-values <br />
In simple terms, a p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. It is also the level of statistical significance and is expressed between 0 and 1. If the p-value below the alpha level (for eg. a level of 0.05) then we will reject the null hypothesis.<br />
for example  p-value means that there is 1% probability for accepting (considering as true) the null hypothesis  <br />
The p-value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true. <br />
P > 0.05 is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. 1 minus the P value is the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true. A statistically significant test result (P ≤ 0.05) means that the test hypothesis is false or should be rejected. A P value greater than 0.05 means that no effect was observed.<br />

**differnce between p value and significance level** <br />
P-Value is the odds that a result would be outside of your distribution whereas the level of significance denotes how confident you can be in your results. For example, if you have a p-value of .05 that means you have a 5% likelihood that whatever you're analyzing has a 5% chance to be outside of your normal distribution. A p-value of .05 also means that you're results are significant at the 95% level. To get your level of significance subtract your p-value from 1. Usually for results to be statistically sound (and this depends on your industry) you'd want a p-value of at least .05 to .01.
**when to use one tail test and two tail test** <br />
if you want to find out any differnce then two tail test if you want to find less than or more than then one tail test
