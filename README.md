### degrees of freedom
the maximum number of logically independent values, which are values that have the freedom to vary, in the data sample.
the number of independent values that can vary in an analysis without breaking any constraints. It is an essential idea that appears in many contexts throughout statistics including hypothesis tests, probability distributions, and linear regression. Learn how this fundamental concept affects the power and precision of your analysis  <br />
it is used to learning model more 
you are giving more information to learning the model <br />
formula=n-k-1(where n is number of data point,k is no.independent variable)
